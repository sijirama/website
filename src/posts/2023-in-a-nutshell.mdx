2023 was a wild ride for me — a year in which I turned 20, marking two decades on this planet. I met some amazing people, but most importantly, I embarked on my coding journey — one of the best decisions I've ever made. I built some cool projects, met fascinating individuals, engaged in lively debates, and explored numerous aspects of this newfound passion. I've never felt so passionate about anything before.

I started with a less-than-optimal system and discovered the power of reviving it using Linux. Jumping straight into the deep end, I installed Arch and upgraded to a better laptop, finding myself immersed in coding at every opportunity.

Throughout the year, I learned the fundamentals of full-stack development, crafting web applications that I hold dear. The Linux experience also introduced me to the basics of Bash scripting. I delved into data structures and algorithms, expanding my knowledge base. Working in two different places added a dynamic aspect to my journey. As a frontend developer using React and Tailwind in the first role, and later as a backend developer specializing in NestJS, I enjoyed the unique challenges of both ends of the spectrum. Collaborating with colleagues, from arguments about backend work to playful banter about frontend responsibilities, made the experience truly enjoyable. I made amazing friends along the way, and honestly, it felt like I woke up from a crazy 20-year dream.

I pushed myself to accomplish something meaningful every chance I got. Coding became an integral part of my lifestyle, creating a sense of value for myself and others. Whether for personal projects, professional endeavors, or just for fun, coding became a defining factor in my life this year. I'm excited to push even harder in the coming year.

2023 was awesome, but lets make 2024 even better.

### Things i learnt this year.

Upon reflecting on the events I experienced, I learned a myriad of things. In the two places I worked, approximately 60% of my knowledge was gained through these experiences. Interacting with both good and challenging individuals teaches a great deal about oneself and the other person.

How did I respond to aggressive interactions from those deemed as "bad people"? How did I react to positive interactions from the "good guys"? Sitting down and contemplating these interactions, along with assessing my responses, reveals a lot about my character, just as it does for anyone.

My responses to such interactions were often not the best, but I'm committed to improvement. That's the true essence of progress—striving to become a more valuable person.

I also learned a new perspective on why and how I should create software. Initially, I was more inclined towards the "grind leetcode, get into FAANG" mindset. However, along the journey, a deeper meaning of software creation emerged within me.

Considering the powerful gift that God has bestowed upon me, it became clear that I shouldn't limit its use solely for personal benefit. There are numerous people I could potentially help, and countless issues in the world that software can address. As a software developer, I find myself on the front lines of this technological warzone. It seems that God wouldn't be pleased if I didn't use these skills and abilities to contribute positively to the world.

Another mindset I acquired was recognizing the importance of creating software while genuinely enjoying the process. Initially, I approached software development as a burden, not fully experiencing the joy it could bring. However, my perspective shifted, and now I code and build things purely for the enjoyment.

I solve LeetCode problems with friends, sharing laughs when we struggle and celebrating our successes. I choose projects that I believe will bring me happiness, even if they are complex. Learning a new language, like Lisp in the middle of the year with attempts at SICP exercises (i didn't pass the second chapter, i totally suck at lisp), became a pursuit fueled by curiosity and enjoyment.

I've come to understand that coding and developing software should not just be a task but something to love and have fun with. It's about finding happiness and excitement in the journey.

### Wtf am i gonna do 2024

Firstly, I'm quite fed up with web development and want to explore another field within software development. As mentioned earlier, I'm driven by the desire to build software that helps people, and solutions aren't always confined to the browser. Although a job might bring me back to web development, as I'm currently broke and unemployed (LMAO).

I aim to engage in more hackathons and attend tech events. I've discovered friends who are also in tech, and 2024 is the year I plan to be more involved in my community. This presents an opportunity to enhance my conversational and social skills, which I know need improvement, it's almost like i'm fucked in that department.

To enhance my learning, both in coding and general knowledge, I'm shifting away from relying on YouTube and committing to using documentation and papers exclusively. This approach will probably give me a deeper understanding of concepts, not solely guided by someone else.

In addition to technical reading, I also plan to delve into fiction books. I love the world of fiction and feel the need to read more, maybe some Ted Dekker i haven't read or something, idk.

Expanding my reservoir of wisdom is a priority, and I'm starting with the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu holy book. Reading books that contribute to my overall understanding and wisdom is a personal goal for 2024.

This decision was challenging for me as a born Christian, and naturally, my first choice should be the Bible. To be honest, I don't have a clear reason for choosing to read the Bhagavad Gita. I came across some really cool proverbs from it, and I felt it would be exciting to explore the full context and understand the deeper meaning behind those proverbs.

### I'm fucking graduating.

Honestly, I can't wait for 2024 to end, as it marks my graduation year. The journey has been incredible, but the university period felt almost like hell, and I'm eager to move on and explore new opportunities, my uni isn't really exciting, that's all i have to say about it.

Thanks for reading ...
